Authentication flow for Discord:
Use token authentication, where the flow is:
- user issues login request form Discord
  - if there isn't a discord linkage to a user account:
    - direct them to the website to connect their wallet
  - else:
    - if that user is currently logged in:
      - create a token in the discord bot for them; they are now logged in via discord
    - else:
      - as them to sign in through the website, then issue the discord log in again
